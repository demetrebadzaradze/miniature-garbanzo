MINIATURE GABANZO  wifi pass stealer

in windows whenever device connects to a wifi and auto conection box is checked (wich mostly is) device remembers every thing about network and saves that in spesific file as xml and funny thing is password is not encripted. but the catch it this comand has to be runed in cmd ""
then is sends password and essid to server
